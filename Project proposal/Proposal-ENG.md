## Project Management

To ensure efficient progress and quality delivery of the project, we will adopt an agile development strategy to enhance teamwork, adaptability, and rapid feedback capabilities. Here are the specific details of our project management strategy:

### Scrum Framework

- **Sprint Planning**: The project will be divided into several two-week sprints. Before each sprint, we will hold planning meetings to clarify the goals and task lists for the next two weeks. Everyone is required to detail their plans for the upcoming two weeks and tag them accordingly for review at the end of the sprint.
- **Sprint Review and Retrospective**: At the end of each sprint, we will hold review meetings to showcase and evaluate the work completed during the phase. This is followed by a retrospective meeting to discuss how to improve efficiency in the next sprint. The Team Leader for each sprint will be rotated among team members to avoid the additional stress of having one person in the role for too long.

### Team Communication and Coordination

- **Communication Tools**: To ensure effective communication among team members, we will mainly use WeChat for daily message exchange and file sharing. We plan to hold full-team meetings every Monday and Friday to plan for the week's work and conduct timely reviews. We have created a Weekly Zoom Meeting room for online situations, although face-to-face meetings are generally preferred.
- **Project Management**: We have chosen GitHub KANBAN as our project management platform, tracking development tasks and bugs through Issues, using a custom tagging system for task classification, setting milestones for planning key phases, and organizing workflows with project boards.

### Version Control Strategy

- **Git and GitHub**: We will use Git for code version control and GitHub as the code repository hosting platform.
- **Branching Strategy**: We will adopt a feature branch strategy, with each new feature or fix developed in independent branches and merged back into the main branch through PRs. This ensures the stability of the main branch and promotes code review. Before each merge, a team member not involved in the branch's development will conduct a code review to ensure code stability.

EchoLink's development is divided into several sprints, the specific number of which can be flexibly adjusted according to project progress and team capability. Through the above management strategies, our team can collaborate efficiently while ensuring development quality and quickly responding to changes in project requirements.


## Risks in Team Projects

In team projects, the risks faced are often multifaceted. Effectively identifying and mitigating these risks is crucial for ensuring project success. Below are the risks anticipated in our project, along with corresponding strategies for response, as discussed in detail by our team:

### Technical Risks

Technical risks involve the possibility that the technology used in the project may not meet expectations or may be more difficult to implement than anticipated (since we have only outlined the basic requirements for the software so far). Possible technical risks for our EchoLink product include but are not limited to compatibility issues with WebRTC technology, performance problems, or security vulnerabilities (even though this is a local LAN development project, there are still inherent risks).

To this end, we have made the following contingency plans:

- In the early stages of the project, conduct prototype design and testing of key technologies to assess their applicability and performance. For the non-essential features listed above, we will make modifications as deemed appropriate after collective discussion and evaluation by the team.
- Regularly conduct code and architecture security reviews to ensure timely discovery and repair of security vulnerabilities. (This is necessary as not everyone is completely proficient in development, and adequate time needs to be allocated for debugging.)

### Project Management Risks

Project management risks involve the scope, timing, and cost of the project being affected by unreasonable arrangements. This also includes sudden events involving team members, skill mismatches, or uneven work distribution, which could lead to project delays or stagnation.

To this end, we have made the following contingency plans:

- Clearly define the entire scope of the project to avoid it expanding indefinitely and becoming unfinishable. The potential future optimizations listed will be considered after the entire project has been implemented and grounded.
- Regularly conduct project reviews and retrospectives, adjusting plans in a timely manner based on project progress and feedback from personnel. We plan to hold two meetings every Monday and Friday for task planning and review for the week, with members taking turns to compile meeting summaries (with the aid of AI tools) for subsequent tracking.
- Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each team member to ensure reasonable task allocation. (There is no clear technical division of labor yet; PM, UI/UX, Front-End, Back-End, Tester roles will be assumed by those proficient in the relevant tasks.)
- Establish backup plans for each person and task to guard against sudden personnel changes and accidents.
